Benchmark Clients
=================

Welcome to the benchmark clients repository which hosts the non-web clients for the [Alfresco Benchmark server](https://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Benchmark_Framework_2.0).

The iOS app allows tests and their runs to be viewed and properties edited. Runs can also be started and stopped in the app.

An Android app is planned but there is no target date.


iOS App Roadmap
---------------

* Bring project up to date (NSURLSession, XCTest, async testing)
* Add Tests & Runs (v1.1)
* Property editing (v1.2)
* iPad/iPhone 6 enhanced run status view (swift, storyboards, size classes) 
* Save results to Alfresco (iOS SDK via CocoaPods)
* Save results to cloud storage (via document provider extension)
* Today widget extension (runs scheduled today? runs completed since last view?)
* Watch app
* Notifications (when test runs complete)
